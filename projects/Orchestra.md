I went to McKinley high school and I spent four years playing the violin in the orchestra. Within those four years, a lot of time was spent to practice up to six pieces, up eighteen sheets of music, every concert. We held 2-3 concerts every semester, and it took a lot of time and dedication to practice for these concerts, much like the time and dedication needed to be a good programmer.
