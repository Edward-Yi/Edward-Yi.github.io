This project required a class called ez for my project and I have to create sticker game with sounds and images. The sound has to play when pressing on the sticker and also play a sound when you place the sticker on the designated area, designated area is at the programmer's discretion. The sticker cannot be placed outside of that area and when pressing a different sticker, that sticker's sound has to play and it needs to switch to that sticker.

This was an individual project, therefore the coding was done by me, however I did not create the pictures or sounds, I also did not take any of these pictures. The other thing that I did not create but was required for the project was the ez java class, helps to create an interface for the sticker game. I tested and debugged my code by making sure it compiles and checking that all the requirements for the project was met.

This was the first time that I built code as big as this, the high school programming class I took went over the names of methods and how they work, even quizzing us on the vocabulary. This was an entirely new thing for me because the only expereince I had on something like this was coding minor things to show that I understand what it is and how it works. Debugging was also something that I sort of understood but I did not have the comprehension to look through the entire code and know how all of these parts work, I was not sure about the ez java class interactions.
