summary: This is my final project for ICS 314 at University of Hawaii at Manoa. It consists of working with three other people, in order to create a functioning website that University of Hawaii users will find useful to look for clubs within their interest and an easier and nicer way for club presidents to show their clubs, the clubs have websites but the official Manoa site only has a spreadsheet of clubs when I am currently writing this.
