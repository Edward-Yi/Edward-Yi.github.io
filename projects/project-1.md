summary: A presentation that explains the basics of computer storage and how DNA can be used for that storage.
---

This is a basic presentation on DNA being used for computer memory storage. It does not contain in depth detail and has some speculation for future usage, due to it being used in a Botany class and not a more technically involved course. It helps to bridge the gap between sciences that do not seem like they can relate at all.
