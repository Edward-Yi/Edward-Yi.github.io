## What is coding standard
It's like the format that professors would like to see your essays or reports, readable and easy to navigate. A giant 10 sentence paragraph that looks like a brick full of words was thrown into essay would make it look bad. It may be possible to say a lot about a subject in those 10 sentences but I know that I want to be reading something that is broken to pieces and I don't have to swallow a pill that I have to force down. This is what coding standards is and aims to achieve, have code formatted in a way that is easy to read and navigate. 

## Time to clean the room
When you have your own room, especially when you were a kid, you have to clean your room and make it look nice and neat. This is what coding standards can become when code is thrown in without the spaces to distinguish them from one another. It would be like a new paragraph of an essay starting in the line after your first one, without any spaces to indicate that its a new paragraph, but you can tell its a new paragraph by the big spaces after the period. This would be the same concept, coding standards are also a habitual way to keep that area of the room clean while you may, accidently, have other areas become messy.

## Don't be afraid of making a mess that you can clean up
Sometimes you have to move things to get to those hard to reach places or you want to add this new figurine that you want to display. This should be the easy part of messing around with a completed code. The hard part is when things break and you start to panic and try to figure out how to solve the problem and making your code look messy. Once the problem is solved, it should be easy to calm down and look over your code. Now its time to unwind and make it look like something you can read instead of some mess that a natural disaster created.
