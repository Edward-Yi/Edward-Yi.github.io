  When you first dip your toe into anything, two thoughts might come to mind, there is a lot in this subject or there does not seem to be much going on. There does not seem to be much going on may be true when starting Javascript, in comparison to Java or C++. One of the biggest contributors is the amount of variable names needed to call numerical variables and strings. Where Java and C++ seperates numerical and string variables, even going as far as having variable names for decimals, Javascript has you using one or two for all of them.

  Even with these thoughts, caution is key because you have to learn how to swim in shallow water before you can take the plunge into the depths. The basics is the foundation and starting off with two variable names and how to call functions in Javascript is the start before introducing loops and if, else if, and else statements. Even a call to the console to see output if the codes between the output creates the intended result or if numbers and words are off.

  Seeing what can be done with Javascript and software engineering is likely a trip down the rabbit hole, not to say that it would be hard or crazy. You could probe out the dark depths of Javascript to see what can be done, looking at apps or websites built with Javascript or how many things were built with it. However, understanding how it works might be impossible when you are starting to learn something that might have a lot of utility or is complex, like different programming languages. Once you learn the things within those depths, it can stick with you for a while.
