## Starting out ...
I don't want to be thrown into a the deep end of a pool and be told to swim, when I don't know how to swim. This is what learning anything new comes down to. On my first look into Javascript, I found it shallow because all the methods, arrays, etc. could be put into varibles with basic methods like let or const. The first impression made me feel like I was put back into elementary school, learning that words are words, whether they are in a list or seperate.
  
  
# What changed?
My basic mindset is to be reserved and try to look at it from another viewpoint, perspective, or try to dig into and see if its just a small deposit or a big cave filled with minerals. Pushing forward, with the idea that there has to be more to this language, I find out that functions can be defined in other functions.  This is like not knowing why, when, or how a musician can play a song this way but you understand that there has to be a reason behind it.

## Can we go deeper?
Seeing something that could be deep is not the same as understanding how deep it is or other things that could be hiding under the surface. An unknown creature in the proverbial lake can cause two reactions fear or curiosity. Wanting to understand the creature that surfaced from the depths or being afraid of what else could be hiding within the abyss. Just a glimpse of the right thing could be the push needed to see what else could be under the surface.
