## What do you mean?
Resumes are the most relevant thing you use to appeal to your employers about why they should be hiring you. Some employers also like to poke around at what sort of person you are on social media accounts and any other forums that you have taken part in. What would the best thing they see be? Professional portfolios that are open and ready to be viewed by those employers that you would be aiming at, maybe even slipping it into the resume or paperwork. It is also an alternative to show your employers a resume that includes more details on where you have worked and how you contrinuted.

## Why keep this in mind?
You never know when or if an employer will one day say, "I want to look at how my employee acts online." Problems can and will occur when they see how your online, professional, personality differs from the attitude you have at the workplace. This is where you need to keep low and careful with an alias for the more private, and legal, ventures. You always have to behave like a child that could be caught for doing something that they are not supposed to.

## Conclusion
Knowing that an employer can look at your social media accounts was something that I understood as a possibility but creating a professional portfolio was something I did not know about. I also understood that being in a forum without an alias can both be dentrimental and helpful because the wrong words be harmful. It is helpful in the case of showing understanding, beliefs, and how social or helpful you are to other people in a public domain. Learning about professional portfolios has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of what else I can do to appeal to them.
