## Does it make sense?
It does, given the proper context. Lets say that you are playing a modern game, most of these games would have you choose 3 modes (easy, normal, hard). It becomes easier to imagine that easy is the lowest difficulty and hard is the highest difficulty. However, where does normal fit in because it could be considered the in between of easy and hard where there is some challenge but not enough to be hard. It may seem like the safe middle ground but lets be honest, simple and easy looking things could be the hardest thing to go through, looking at you rubik's cube.

## Strategy
When I think of Semantic UI in comparison to regular html and css programming, I think of the difference between Advanced Wars and chess. You don't need to know what advanced wars is but think of it like an old tabletop war game that is digital. Chess is all about set positions and movement, this is what I would compare to Semantic UI. In comparison to Advanced Wars where pieces are set in movement but there may more objectives than to capture the king. You also have to manage fuel, have unit advantage in mind (anti-air beats aircrafts), and you have to be careful of possible ambushes or reinforcements. Chess is easier to manage and play than the other but that does not mean it is easy to play chess, at an advanced level, knowing just the basics of the game.


## Lets make it easier to understand
If you still don't get it, lets wrap it up with a summary that may be been easier to understand and put this entire essay together, maybe making you feel like you wasted your time. With html and css we have to learn a lot more of the mechanics of how these languages work in order to do the things that we can in Semantic UI. Semantic UI is like a way to cut corners, make the long passages that would be your menu turn into something shorter and easy to understand. It is human nature, at this point, to cut corners wherever we can and make our lives easier, like using robots to cut the cost of human workers and have efficient workers that won't get tired.
