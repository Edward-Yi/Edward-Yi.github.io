# Overview
The problem: You may want to startup a project and you may be good at writing stories. However, you don't know enough about animating, music, or any other field.

The solution: A website where you can post a project, to look for people to help work on this project, or look at those projects. People with specific skills, that have posted themselves as available, can also be looked at, before posting the project.

# Mockup Page Ideas
* Landing Page
* Login/Signup Page
* User Page 
* Admin Page 
* Skill search Page
* Project posting page

# Case Ideas
* User ends up in the landing page, sign up/sign in, sets up profile (signing up), goes to profile
* User goes to project posting page, notes an interest, user that posted project gets a notification of an interested party
* User goes to search skill page, post as available (with skillset), get a notification of an interested party
* User goes to post, edits their post
* Admin goes to landing page, log in, make changes to skill search and project posting

# Beyond Basics
* Automatically lists the skills from profile when hitting available on skill search page
* Message interface
* Rating system for project leader or skill of a person
