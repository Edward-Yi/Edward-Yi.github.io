# Design pattern and definition
The question to start with is what is design pattern? The answer that everyone will jump to is the patterns that you would see in something like a painting. However, programming does not look at it as a visual aesthetic but as way to break things down to classes/files and functions, variables, or results that will be within these classes/files. It is tedious to draw boxes with texts that have lines or arrows that indicate connection but it may be just the thing you need to work out what people will do in a project. Does this mean every part of the project will be like this? Not really because there may be complications or changes to the actual program and it may be different from the initial projections everyone thinks of.
  
# What design patterns do I use?
I always like to start with questions that are relevant to what I need in the software and what is my initial idea for what the software will look like. The first thing you do is to have a name. This may seem like something stupid but starting with an easy to call and recall name for your files is something that you would want to have with multiple files, therefore, it needs to be about the project and its name. Next, I think about what that file will be doing, what I need to import for the file, and a general outline of what functions and variables that I think will be in the file. Before I make the file, I look it over and think about anymore connections or double check the design pattern, checking for any mistakes or missing items.
